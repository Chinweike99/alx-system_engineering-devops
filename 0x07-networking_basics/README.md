**OSI Model**
 - The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of
a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers facilitate interoperability
and communication between different systems by providing a clear and organized structure.
 - __Physical Layer__:  Deals with the physical connection between devices. It defines the hardware elements, such as cables, connectors, and signaling.
 - __Data Link Layer__: Responsible for the reliable transmission of data between directly connected nodes. It handles issues like framing, error detection, and flow control.
 - __Network Layer__: Manages the logical addressing and routing of data between different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination.
 - __Transport Layer__: Ensures end-to-end communication, providing error detection, flow control, and retransmission of lost or corrupted data
 - __Session Layer__: Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It manages dialogue control and synchronization.
 - __Presentation Layer__: Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers. It is responsible for data formatting, encryption, and compression.
 - __Application Layer__: This Provides network services directly to end-users or applications. It supports communication services such as email, file transfer, and network browsing.

**Organization**
 The OSI model is organized hierarchically, with each layer building upon the services provided by the layers below it. Data is encapsulated at each layer as it travels down the stack and decapsulated as it moves up. This modular organization allows for easy understanding and troubleshooting of network-related issues. Each layer communicates with the adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.
